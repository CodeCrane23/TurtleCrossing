# TurtleCrossing
Classic Road crossing game using Python and Turtle Graphics.
Another simple yet quite informative project using Turtle graphics and basic python programming.
The turtle crosses the road while avoiding moving cars and reaches the other side.
After safely reaching the other side, it gets reset to its original point and now the spped of the moving cars increase.
